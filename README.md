======

wplotView is a Python script to visualize Wannier functions generated by wien2wannier.  
It shows isosurfaces of the Wannier orbitals taking into account the phase of the complex wavefunction,
and the crystal structure.

It uses the ``Visualization Toolkit'' library within Python providing an easy, fast and open alternative to more fully featured
visualization applications.
